## Inspiration
Have you ever found yourself free one day, then you hit up your friends to go see a movie? Perhaps go get some food? Maybe a movie? So have we! We'd go to our phones, open the group chat, then as "Is anyone free X-day?" Then we'd wait....and wait....oh look! One person is free! So you wait longer...and longer...oh man, another person can't make it. Dang it, the whole crew can't make it. __If only there were an application that allowed myself and my friends to input our schedules and it'd overlay my group's schedule so we can see when we are/aren't free.__
